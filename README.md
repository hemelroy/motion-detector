# motion-detector
### This program detects moving objects and makes note of the time it entered and exited the frame

Running the file "plot_detections.py" will begin the program. This code is designed with the intention of using a laptop camera as the motion detector.
The program will continually run until the user enters 'q' on their keyboard. Any detected objects will be outlined in a blue rectangle. Once the program is terminated, the data regarding when an object was detected is displayed on a graph that will automatically open, presented in an HTML file. A sample of what the graph would look like is provided.
